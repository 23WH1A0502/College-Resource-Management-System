# College Resource Management System (MERN Stack)

## Introduction
The College Resource Management System is a MERN stack based web application designed to manage and allocate college resources such as classrooms, laboratories, seminar halls, and equipment using a centralized digital platform.

## Purpose
The purpose of this system is to replace manual resource booking, reduce conflicts, and ensure efficient and transparent utilization of college resources.

## Technology Stack
- MongoDB – Database  
- Express.js – Backend framework  
- React – Frontend library  
- Node.js – Server runtime  

## Architectural Principles (StackTrack Reference)
- Database-first design  
- Backend controls business rules  
- Centralized authentication and authorization  
- REST API based communication  

## User Roles
- **Admin**: Manages resources and approvals  
- **Faculty**: Requests and monitors resources  
- **Students**: Requests available resources  

## Core Features
- Resource management and scheduling  
- Request and approval workflow  
- Real-time availability tracking  
- Usage history and logs  

## Backend Design
The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js. It provides versioned REST APIs and handles authentication, role-based access control, and data validation.

## Frontend Design (React)
The frontend is built using React with functional components, hooks, and context for authentication and state management.

## Security
- JWT-based authentication  
- Role-based authorization at backend  
- Secure and validated API endpoints  

## Conclusion
The College Resource Management System implemented using the MERN stack offers a secure, scalable, and efficient solution for managing college resources while following industry-style architecture principles.
